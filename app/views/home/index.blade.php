			<h2>#Deimos</h2>
			<p>
			<b>Deimos</b> is an ambitious projet for our freshman year at <em>EPITA</em>. It is basically an old school competitive 3D FPS featuring unique gameplay mechanisms, such as a "mystery" weapon that allows to challenge other players in fun mini-games instead of a classical gun fight.

				<b>Deimos</b> is being developped by four members: Manou Manouel (game engine), Cyrilou (visuals/sounds), Uranus (gameplay) & Loupou (server/networking). We have already come a long way during the creation of the game, as the graphical engine is mostly complete, along with working physics, WIP server and miscellaneous gameplay elements.
